# Scraping and automatic pricing of apartments in Tokyo
This repo was the front end for a process I built using scrapy / dynamoDB / elasticsearch and a mix of a NN and xgboost to automatically scrape apartments in suumo.jp and homes.jp, price them using every metacharacteristic of the listing, save the pictures, and js renderings of the page, and use this to visualize everything.
